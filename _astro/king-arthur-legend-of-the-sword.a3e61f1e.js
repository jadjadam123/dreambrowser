Over eight days, Bart used his spray cans to transform a large billboard at one of Belgium’s biggest movie theater into a vibrant 72m² piece of art, infusing the campaign with a sense of surprise and delight. This live act didn't just earn the attention of those passing by; it encouraged people to share photos and videos on their own social media, significantly expanding the reach of the campaign.",
